## 🎯 Complete WETH Implementation - End-to-End Working Solution

### ✅ Final Architecture Overview

After discovering that **USDC doesn't work with Aave on Base Sepolia testnet**, the application was completely rebuilt to use **WETH (Wrapped Ethereum)** exclusively. This resulted in a fully functional wallet that integrates with Aave V3 lending pools.

### 🔧 Contract Configuration (Base Sepolia)

```typescript
export const CONTRACT_ADDRESSES = {
  WETH: '0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006',        // Native WETH on Base Sepolia
  AAVE_POOL: '0x8bAB6d1b75f19e9eD9fCe8b9BD338844fF79aE27',   // Aave V3 Pool (CORRECTED)
  A_WETH: '0x73a5bB60b0B0fc35710DDc0ea9c407031E31Bdbb',     // aBasSepWETH (Interest-bearing token)
} as const
```

**🚨 Critical Fix Applied**: The initial implementation used an incorrect Aave Pool address (`0x6Ae43d3271ff6888e7Fc43Fd7321a503ff738951`) which caused transaction failures. This was corrected to the proper address above.

### 📋 Transaction Flow Implementation

#### **WETH Supply to Aave Flow**
1. **User Input Validation**: Ensures amount is valid and user has sufficient balance
2. **WETH Approval Transaction**:
   ```typescript
   // First transaction: Approve Aave Pool to spend WETH
   const approveData = encodeFunctionData({
     abi: erc20Abi,
     functionName: 'approve',
     args: [CONTRACT_ADDRESSES.AAVE_POOL, amountInWei],
   })
   ```

3. **Aave Supply Transaction**:
   ```typescript
   // Second transaction: Supply WETH to Aave
   const supplyData = encodeFunctionData({
     abi: aavePoolAbi,
     functionName: 'supply',
     args: [CONTRACT_ADDRESSES.WETH, amountInWei, activeWallet.address, 0],
   })
   ```

4. **Real-time Updates**: Balances automatically refresh after successful transactions

#### **WETH Withdraw from Aave Flow**
1. **Position Validation**: Ensures user has sufficient supplied balance
2. **Direct Withdraw Transaction**:
   ```typescript
   // Single transaction: Withdraw WETH from Aave
   const withdrawData = encodeFunctionData({
     abi: aavePoolAbi,
     functionName: 'withdraw',
     args: [CONTRACT_ADDRESSES.WETH, amountInWei, activeWallet.address],
   })
   ```

3. **Balance Updates**: Both wallet and Aave balances update automatically

### 🏗️ Component Architecture

#### **Core Components**
1. **`WETHBalance.tsx`**: Displays wallet WETH balance with refresh functionality
2. **`AaveWETHLending.tsx`**: Complete Aave interface with supply/withdraw operations
3. **`SimpleWalletContext.tsx`**: Simplified wallet state management
4. **`Header.tsx`**: Navigation with wallet connection and network switching

#### **Custom Hooks**
1. **`useWETHBalance.ts`**: Fetches and manages WETH balance state
2. **`useAaveWETHOperations.ts`**: Handles all Aave supply/withdraw operations

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation Decisions

#### **1. Simplified Context Architecture**
**Decision**: Replaced complex `PrivyWalletContext` with `SimpleWalletContext`
**Rationale**: 
- Reduced complexity and eliminated unused functionality
- Focused only on essential wallet state (isConnected, address, isLoading)
- Direct integration with Privy hooks (`usePrivy`, `useWallets`)

#### **2. Wallet Prioritization Logic**
```typescript
// Prioritizes injected wallets over embedded wallets
const activeWallet = wallets.find(wallet => wallet.connectorType === 'injected') || wallets[0]
```
**Rationale**: Users prefer using their existing wallets (Rabby, MetaMask) over embedded alternatives

### 🔄 Migration from USDC to WETH

#### **Why the Change Was Necessary**
- **USDC Incompatibility**: USDC is not supported by Aave V3 on Base Sepolia testnet
