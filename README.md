# SOVRA Wallet - Complete WETH Wallet with Gasless Transactions

✅ **Project Status: COMPLETED**

A production-ready Web3 wallet featuring WETH balance management, Aave V3 lending integration, and gasless transactions through Privy smart wallets with Pimlico paymaster sponsorship.

## Project Setup & Implementation

### Technology Stack
- **React 18 + TypeScript** - Type-safe component architecture
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling for responsive design
- **Vite** - Fast development and optimized builds
- **Privy + Smart Wallets** - Authentication with account abstraction
- **Pimlico Paymaster** - Gasless transaction sponsorship
- **Viem + Wagmi** - Type-safe blockchain interactions
- **Base Sepolia** - Production testnet deployment

### Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Environment** (Required)
   ```bash
   # Create .env.local with Privy configuration
   VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID=your-privy-app-id-here
   VITE_BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC=https://sepolia.base.org
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for Production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
